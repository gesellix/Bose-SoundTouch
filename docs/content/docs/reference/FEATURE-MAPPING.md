title: "Feature Mapping Guide"
---
This guide demonstrates the comprehensive endpoint-to-feature mapping system that helps you understand exactly what your SoundTouch device can do and how to use it effectively.

## Overview

The SoundTouch API client now includes intelligent feature mapping that:
- **Maps 103+ endpoints** to **15+ functional features**
- **Categorizes capabilities** by type (Core, Audio, Playback, etc.)
- **Identifies device limitations** and missing features
- **Provides personalized recommendations** based on your device
- **Shows exact CLI commands** for each supported feature

## Quick Start

## Feature Mapping in Code

### Using the Feature Mapping API
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/gesellix/bose-soundtouch/pkg/client"
)

func analyzeDevice(host string) {
    // Create client
    c := client.NewClient(&client.Config{Host: host})
    
    // Get supported URLs with feature mapping
    supportedURLs, err := c.GetSupportedURLs()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    
    // Get device capabilities overview
    completeness, supported, total := supportedURLs.GetFeatureCompleteness()
    fmt.Printf("Device supports %d%% of features (%d/%d)\n", 
        completeness, supported, total)
    
    // Check specific capabilities
    if supportedURLs.HasMultiroomSupport() {
        fmt.Println("✅ Device can create multiroom zones")
    }
    
    if supportedURLs.HasAdvancedAudioSupport() {
        fmt.Println("✅ Device has advanced audio controls")
    }
    
    // Get missing essential features
    missing := supportedURLs.GetMissingEssentialFeatures()
    if len(missing) > 0 {
        fmt.Println("❌ Missing essential features:")
        for _, feature := range missing {
            fmt.Printf("   • %s\n", feature.Name)
        }
    }
    
    // Get features by category
    featuresByCategory := supportedURLs.GetFeaturesByCategory()
    for category, features := range featuresByCategory {
        fmt.Printf("%s: %d features available\n", category, len(features))
    }
    
    // Check for partial implementations
    partial := supportedURLs.GetPartiallyImplementedFeatures()
    for _, feature := range partial {
        fmt.Printf("⚠️ %s is partially supported\n", feature.Name)
    }
}
```

### Custom Feature Analysis
```go

    requiredEndpoints := []string{
        "/audiodspcontrols",
        "/audioproducttonecontrols", 
        "/audioproductlevelcontrols",
    }
    
    for _, endpoint := range requiredEndpoints {
        if !supportedURLs.HasURL(endpoint) {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}

// Get device-specific recommendations
func getPersonalizedTips(supportedURLs *models.SupportedURLsResponse) []string {

## Feature Detection Patterns

### Checking Device Capabilities
```bash
# Quick capability check
soundtouch-cli supported-urls | grep "Feature Coverage"

# Essential features verification  
soundtouch-cli analyze | grep -A 5 "Missing Essential Features"

# Advanced features check
soundtouch-cli supported-urls --features | grep "Advanced Audio"

# Multiroom capability
soundtouch-cli supported-urls --features | grep "Multiroom"
```

### Device Classification
Based on feature support, devices are automatically classified:

- **Premium SoundTouch Speaker**: Multiroom + Advanced Audio + Full Feature Set
- **Standard SoundTouch Speaker**: Multiroom Capable + Core Features  
- **Basic SoundTouch Speaker**: Streaming + Presets + Core Features
- **Essential SoundTouch Device**: Core Playback Features Only
- **Limited SoundTouch Device**: Minimal Feature Set

## Troubleshooting with Feature Mapping

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Command not working"
```bash
# Check if feature is supported
soundtouch-cli supported-urls --features | grep -i "bass control"
# If not listed, device doesn't support bass control
```

**Issue**: "Multiroom not available"  
```bash
# Verify multiroom support
soundtouch-cli analyze | grep "Multiroom"
# Check specific endpoints
soundtouch-cli supported-urls --verbose | grep -i zone
```

**Issue**: "Station search failing"
```bash
# Check content navigation support
soundtouch-cli source availability
# Verify streaming service status
soundtouch-cli supported-urls --features | grep "Content Navigation"
```

### Device Recommendations

The feature mapping system provides personalized recommendations:

- **Missing Balance Control**: "No balance control available on this device"
- **Multiroom Available**: "Create speaker groups with other devices"  
- **Advanced Audio**: "Fine-tune sound with DSP controls"
- **Limited Features**: "Consider upgrading for full functionality"

## Best Practices

1. **Always check device capabilities first** with `soundtouch-cli analyze`
2. **Use feature-specific commands** rather than trying unsupported features
3. **Check service availability** before attempting streaming operations
4. **Review recommendations** for optimal device usage
5. **Monitor feature completeness** to understand device limitations

This comprehensive feature mapping system ensures you get the most out of your SoundTouch device by understanding exactly what it can do and how to use it effectively.
